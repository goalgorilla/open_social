description: |-
  Allows sitemanagers and content managers to create book pages that can be
  organized in a hierarchy. An example use is the documentation on Open Social's
  own community: Community Talks.

  Marked for rework because the book module is moving from core to contrib in
  Drupal 11, this requires work to be done on this module. Additionally the
  book module that this leans on provides its own content type which creates
  issues when trying to install all modules at install time. Future versions
  of that module move it to a recipe which requires us to ship our own book
  type or include the capability in our generic page content type.
