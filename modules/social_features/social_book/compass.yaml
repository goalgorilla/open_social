  Allows sitemanagers and content managers to create book pages that can be organized in a hierarchy. An example use is the documentation on Open
  Social's own community: Community Talks.


  Marked for rework because the book module is moving from core to contrib in Drupal 11, this requires work to be done on this module. Additionally
  the book module that this leans on provides its own content type which creates issues when trying to install all modules at install time. Future
  versions of that module move it to a recipe which requires us to ship our own book type or include the capability in our generic page content type.
