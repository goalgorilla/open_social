name: Social Download Count
id: null
description: |-
  Provides a download count for files downloaded through the private file
  system.

  Marked as deprecated because we've moved from the private to the secret file
  system with which this module doesn't work. Additionally these kinds of things
  should be part of generic analytics solutions rather than specific for
  downloads through a certain file system.
