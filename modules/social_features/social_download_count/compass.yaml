description: >-
  Provides a download count for files downloaded through the private file system.


  Marked as deprecated because we've moved from the private to the secret file system with which this module doesn't work. Additionally these kinds of
  things should be part of generic analytics solutions rather than specific for downloads through a certain file system.
