  Provides building blocks for Open Social features that are suited to be made on top of the group module.


  Marked for rework because the current module still contains a lot of structure from when this contained our group type features (which is now in
  Flexible Group). Similarly a lot of the submodules likely should be merged in the main module in a way where they can be easily enabled or disabled
  for different features that work on group. Some of this work was done in the group migration but more effort is still needed.
