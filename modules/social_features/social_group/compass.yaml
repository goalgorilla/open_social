  Provides building blocks for Open Social features that are suited to be made
  on top of the group module.

  Marked for rework because the current module still contains a lot of structure
  from when this contained our group type features (which is now in Flexible
  Group). Similarly a lot of the submodules likely should be merged in the main
  module in a way where they can be easily enabled or disabled for different
  features that work on group. Some of this work was done in the group migration
  but more effort is still needed.
