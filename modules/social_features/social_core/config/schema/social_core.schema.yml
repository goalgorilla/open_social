        Whether to opt-in to Open Social's implementation for the query access handlers.
        This alters query_access handler's for Drupal's built-in entities to work with Open Social.
        This is opt-in because it may interfere with custom query_access handlers platforms already
        have in place. This is required when using the GraphQL API.
      deprecated: >-
        The 'use_entity_access_api' setting is deprecated in social:10.2.0 and is removed from social:11.0.0
        at which point custom query_access handlers should extend or decorate the query_access handlers from
        Open Social and the Open Social query_access handlers will be unconditionally enabled.
