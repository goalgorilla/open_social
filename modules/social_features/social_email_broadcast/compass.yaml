  This module provides the ability to unsubscribe from mass e-mails such as
  messages from group managers or event organisers.

  Marked for consideration because if we need these kinds of capabilities they
  should be part of our core e-mail functionality rather than an add-on.
  Additionally the current module can cause a user to disable all e-mail from a
  platform which leaves a site manager without the ability to contact them in
  case of emergency (i.e. when legal reasons might compel them to do so).
