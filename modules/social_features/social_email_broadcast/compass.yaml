  This module provides the ability to unsubscribe from mass e-mails such as messages from group managers or event organisers.


  Marked for consideration because if we need these kinds of capabilities they should be part of our core e-mail functionality rather than an add-on.
  Additionally the current module can cause a user to disable all e-mail from a platform which leaves a site manager without the ability to contact
  them in case of emergency (i.e. when legal reasons might compel them to do so).
