name: Social Follow Content
id: null
description: |-
  Allows the user to follow content and get notified about updates (e.g. new
  comments).

  Marked for rework because this is currently a feature that makes changes to
  content. However, this should really be a system to which different types of
  objects can opt in and make decisions of when a following user should get an
  update (e.g. event date changes should also trigger this).

  There's also duplication between this and the follow "taxonomy" and "user"
  systems which further indicates the concept of "following" should be a system
  that other features can opt-in to.
