  Allows the user to follow content and get notified about updates (e.g. new comments).


  Marked for rework because this is currently a feature that makes changes to content. However, this should really be a system to which different
  types of objects can opt in and make decisions of when a following user should get an update (e.g. event date changes should also trigger this).


  There's also duplication between this and the follow "taxonomy" and "user" systems which further indicates the concept of "following" should be a
  system that other features can opt-in to.
