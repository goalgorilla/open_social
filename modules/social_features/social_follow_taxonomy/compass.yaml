name: Social Follow Content
id: null
description: |-
  Allows the user to follow content tagging terms which will notify them when
  content is created with that term or when the term is added as a tag to
  already existing content.

  Marked for rework due to the duplication between this and the other follow
  modules which shows the need for a more centralized follow system that other
  features or systems can opt-in to.
