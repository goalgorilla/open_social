description: >-
  Allows the user to follow content tagging terms which will notify them when content is created with that term or when the term is added as a tag to
  already existing content.


  Marked for rework due to the duplication between this and the other follow modules which shows the need for a more centralized follow system that
  other features or systems can opt-in to.
