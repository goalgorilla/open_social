  Provides the functionality that powers the user profiles.

  Marked for reconsideration because we currently split the user functionality
  into `social_user` and `social_profile` to match the split between the core
  user and community profile module. We may want to change it over to having a
  module that provides the underlying system and a different module that
  provides all the necessary UI elements.
