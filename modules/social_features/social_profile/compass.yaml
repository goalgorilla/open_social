  Provides the functionality that powers the user profiles.


  Marked for reconsideration because we currently split the user functionality into `social_user` and `social_profile` to match the split between the
  core user and community profile module. We may want to change it over to having a module that provides the underlying system and a different module
  that provides all the necessary UI elements.
