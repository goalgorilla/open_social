description: |-
  Allows users to organize events on the platform. Platform members can enroll
  to these events.

  Contains optional sub-features:
  - The ability to add events to your calendar.
  - The ability for anonymous users to enroll to events.
  - The ability to invite users to the events.
  - The ability to limit the number of enrollments to the event.
  - The ability to classify events using a "type" taxonomy.

  Marked for reconsideration because a lot of these optional features likely
  should be rolled into the main module.
