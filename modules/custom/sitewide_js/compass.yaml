  The Sitewide JS module allows sitemanagers to introduce JavaScript snippets that run on every page.


  This module is marked as deprecated because we know that custom JavaScript can have serious performance, maintainability, support, and security
  drawbacks. For example, any JavaScript setting an unknown cookie can completely break caching on a platform.
