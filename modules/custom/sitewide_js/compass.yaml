  The Sitewide JS module allows sitemanagers to introduce JavaScript snippets
  that run on every page.

  This module is marked as deprecated because we know that custom JavaScript can
  have serious performance, maintainability, support, and security drawbacks.
  For example, any JavaScript setting an unknown cookie can completely break
  caching on a platform.
