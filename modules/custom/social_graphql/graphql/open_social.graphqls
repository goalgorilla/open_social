# This file contains the basis of the Open Social GraphQL API Schema. It       #
# provides base types that can be used by individual Open Social features.     #
# Additionally it contains common interfaces for things such as pagination.    #

# Comments aimed at schema developers are prefixed with `#` and comments       #
# exposed to schema consumers are contained in `"""`.                          #
