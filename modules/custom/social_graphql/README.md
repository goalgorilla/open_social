# Social GraphQL

This is the base module for the Open Social GraphQL API.

If you're trying to find out how to extend this and what all the `.graphqls`
files and plugins are for, I strongly recommend going through the
[GraphQL 4.x documentation](https://drupal-graphql.gitbook.io/graphql/v/8.x-4.x/)
which explains the what's and why's of Drupal GraphQL APIs.
