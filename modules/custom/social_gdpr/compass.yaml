  Integration module for the data policy system and Open Social. Allows customers to configure one or more policies to which users should/must agree
  if they want to use the product.


  Site managers can determine if they want the policy to be required or not. If a user does not want to agree to a required policy then they have the
  option to delete their account instead.
