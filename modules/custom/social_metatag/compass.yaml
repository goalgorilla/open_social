description: |-
  Provides a few leftover implementations for supporting metatag on views. The
  metatag configuration has instead been moved to the modules that own the
  object for which the config is needed.

  Marked for reconsideration because this module should not be needed if all the
  features have proper optional support for configuring their metatag
  configuration and the metatag module is always enabled as a feature during
  platform install.
