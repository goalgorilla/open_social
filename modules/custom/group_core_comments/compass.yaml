  This module appears (but it's unclear) to render a specific block for comments in case a user is not a member of a group, making it easy to quickly
  join. Additionally, this module seems to perform some access handling around comments in groups and adds global permissions for comments.


  Marked as deprecated and for rework since this is unlikely to be something a whole module should do. It's expected that the group module itself can
  provide us with the access handling around comments and the UI element may be a reusable part of our group integration that can be re-used where
  needed.
