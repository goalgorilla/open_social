name: Group Core Comments
id: null
description: |-
  This module appears (but it's unclear) to render a specific block for comments
  in case a user is not a member of a group, making it easy to quickly join.
  Additionally, this module seems to perform some access handling around
  comments in groups and adds global permissions for comments.

  Marked as deprecated and for rework since this is unlikely to be something a
  whole module should do. It's expected that the group module itself can provide
  us with the access handling around comments and the UI element may be a
  reusable part of our group integration that can be re-used where needed.
