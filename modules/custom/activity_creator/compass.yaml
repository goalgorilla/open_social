  Provides the core of the activity system. The entity and plugin managers are defined in this library and the link to Message entities which store
  information about notification text and recipient channels is maintained here.


  When a new activity is created this module will kick-off the processing. It'll also take care of updating/deleting an activity when the content it
  relates to is updated or removed.
