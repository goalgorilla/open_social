  A module that was set-up to perform some path management where it didn't yet exist.


  Marked for deprecation because the current implementation has significant performance drawbacks, performing router rebuilds. Instead this should be
  implemented using the pathauto and sub-pathauto modules. Those modules have broader community support and solve the mentioned performance issue.
