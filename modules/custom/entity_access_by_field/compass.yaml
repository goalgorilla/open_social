description: |-
  Provides a way to configure visibility of an entity based on the field of that
  entity.

  Currently uses node grants and although some flexibility around visibility is
  provided, this is done by a single "allowed_values_function" from the
  underlying list_item. Although in theory the values for the list-item can be
  changed per entity (e.g. in posts they're 1 and 2 while in nodes they're
  public and community), there is code that relies on the values being specific.
  Only public visibility can currently be disabled.

  This should be reworked so that it no longer uses node-grants. Additionally we
  should likely create a plugin system for the visibility types since both our
  group implementation and our "visibility_by_role" extension alter the
  available values and behaviour here. This indicates an incorrect
  responsibility direction. This module should provide a system for the storage
  of the visibility setting as well as control over which values are available
  for which types of object (ensuring disabling 'public' is not a special case).
