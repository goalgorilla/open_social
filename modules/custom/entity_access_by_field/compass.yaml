  Provides a way to configure visibility of an entity based on the field of that entity.


  Currently uses node grants and although some flexibility around visibility is provided, this is done by a single "allowed_values_function" from the
  underlying list_item. Although in theory the values for the list-item can be changed per entity (e.g. in posts they're 1 and 2 while in nodes
  they're public and community), there is code that relies on the values being specific. Only public visibility can currently be disabled.


  This should be reworked so that it no longer uses node-grants. Additionally we should likely create a plugin system for the visibility types since
  both our group implementation and our "visibility_by_role" extension alter the available values and behaviour here. This indicates an incorrect
  responsibility direction. This module should provide a system for the storage of the visibility setting as well as control over which values are
  available for which types of object (ensuring disabling 'public' is not a special case).
