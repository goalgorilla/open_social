description: |-
  Provides other features the ability to create a one-time login link. This
  differs from the abilities provided by Drupal core which only allows such a
  link for password reset. The Magic Login system allows links to be created
  with arbitrary destinations and will only redirect to the set password screen
  if the user is logging in and has no password set.
