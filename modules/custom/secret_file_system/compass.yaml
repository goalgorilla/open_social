  The Secret file system provides a StreamWrapper that generates static, unguessable, time-limited URLs. Files are stored in the same place as when
  Drupal's built-in Private file system would be used.


  When this file system is used the assumption is made that if a user can view a link to a file then they can also access the file. The URL that's
  generated is bucketed into time-slots so that multiple people viewing something referencing the file within the same bucket receive the same URL.
  The URL contains all the needed information to validate the URL. This has the benefit that the URLs can be validated only using the information in
  the URL. The responses of the URL can also be statically cached until the URL expires.

  This system provides a significant performance improvement over the private filesystem by not requiring run-time access checks. Unfortunately,
  due to image styles, it's not yet possible to eliminate a Drupal bootstrap entirely when handling the uncached response to a secret file URL.
