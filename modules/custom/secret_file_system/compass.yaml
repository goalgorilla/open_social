  The Secret file system provides a StreamWrapper that generates static,
  unguessable, time-limited URLs. Files are stored in the same place as when
  Drupal's built-in Private file system would be used.

  When this file system is used the assumption is made that if a user can view a
  link to a file then they can also access the file. The URL that's generated is
  bucketed into time-slots so that multiple people viewing something referencing
  the file within the same bucket receive the same URL. The URL contains all the
  needed information to validate the URL. This has the benefit that the URLs can
  be validated only using the information in the URL. The responses of the URL
  can also be statically cached until the URL expires.

  This system provides a significant performance improvement over the private
  filesystem by not requiring run-time access checks. Unfortunately, due to
  image styles, it's not yet possible to eliminate a Drupal bootstrap entirely
  when handling the uncached response to a secret file URL.
