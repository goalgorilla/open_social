description: |-
  This module provides demo content for Open Social installations during
  development or demos.

  It's marked for rework to look at how we can make this kind of content
  more maintainable on a feature level, since a lot of newer features
  don't have demo content. Additionally, newer Drupal initiatives (like
  Recipes) provide better new ways to include demo content.
