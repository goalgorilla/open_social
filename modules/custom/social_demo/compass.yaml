  This module provides demo content for Open Social installations during development or demos.


  It's marked for rework to look at how we can make this kind of content more maintainable on a feature level, since a lot of newer features don't
  have demo content. Additionally, newer Drupal initiatives (like Recipes) provide better new ways to include demo content.
