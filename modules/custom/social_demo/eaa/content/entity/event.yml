    <p> Hi fellow community members! As you know, Earth Day is coming up again next year! Earth Day is an annual event celebrated around the world to demonstrate support for environmental protection. We want to make sure everyone is aware that it’s coming up, what they can do to help, and that they can even organize their own protest! We will be handing out flyers and will be available to speak to anyone that shows interest. </p>

    <p>As you are all well aware, the government has not  proposed any new actions that support sustainability for far too long. We need to act NOW if we want to see change.</p>
    <p>You can read more about how our <a href=‘https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/20/our-leaders-are-ignoring-global-warming-to-the-point-of-criminal-negligence-its-unforgivable' target=‘_blank’>leaders around the world are ignoring global warming.</a> </p>
    <p>We feel that this should and has to have a high priority in our government.  For those who cannot attend we will announce the online component to this protest here. </p>
    <p>If you cannot make your own protest sign let us know in the comments and we will provide one for you.</p>
    <p>If you need help with transportation getting to the protest please send me a personal message so we can arrange this for you. If you own a car or minivan that can help transport people to the protest also please do get in touch!</p>
    <p>Let’s make it a great day of coming together and working towards positive change! </p>
