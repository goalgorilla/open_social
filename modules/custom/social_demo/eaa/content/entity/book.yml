    <p>The Educational Assistance Association is an NGO that works on improving educational assistance for people who need additional educational support on all levels. We support students from primary school up to PhD levels at university who require educational assistance. We provide both practical support, by connecting educators and other education specialists with students in need and lobby and organize protests and events for structural improvements to the British educational system for special needs students. Our benefactors range from students who need to be home schooled or require special aides due to health or other reasons, as well as students with learning disabilities and gifted students as all these students (and their parents) require specialized assistance to benefit optimally from their education. </p>
