    <p>This manual explains the ins and outs of the EEA community. Please take the time to read through it carefully. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact one of the EEA staff members. </p>
    <p>The Environmental Education Association is an NGO that empowers people and organizations to take action to create a more sustainable planet. We connect volunteers that help ensure that people have the motivation, knowledge, and skills to develop and share their environmental values. We do this by partnering up with schools, education, and other environmental organizations to organize educational events, experiences, and workshops. We also provide practical support by connecting volunteers with educators and helping to organize protests for improvements to the educational system about sustainability. Together, we want to work together towards creating a better world.</p>

    <p>The community has been live since 2015 and has been moderately active since with the Community Manager posting about 50% of the content while the other 50% is User Generated. This is also partly due to the fact that the EEA wants to use its community platform as a source to spread its own information such as educational tools and events.  </p>
    <p> We are now a community of staff, volunteers and other interested parties, (parents, students and people with an educational or political background). We welcome anyone that’s interested in helping to make the planet a better place. </p>
