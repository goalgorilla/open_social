    <p>As you all know I am no longer a student, ha! Asking for a friend however. Her son is at uni and has a learning disability which means he has trouble finishing his exams on time. I seem to recall there are provisions that allow for extra time on exams for certain students. Does anybody know more on how to request this?</p>

    <p>Hi everyone in the EEA online community! </p>
    <p>It’s time for our monthly EEA update! </p>
    <p>First and foremost I’d like to thank all the volunteers that helped cold calling universities to help kickstart our campaign to get a nation wide policy for educational assistance in higher education! Special shout-out to [~Cb92f0c9-1d34-4c05-a50b-2ea985342953] who got TEN universities to support our campaign! </p>
    <p>We are currently working hard on the follow up of the campaign. Other things that are happening surrounding the EEA community right now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We are working on a new volunteer handbook. London based volunteers can review the latest draft in the London volunteer group</li>
        <li>Birmingham based teachers: [~42fc0a3c-5e90-44a3-bfab-8b0ea7b6dead] is organizing the first teacher meetup in your area [link=4bc246e0-7061-4a2e-977a-35da40575a1c], be sure to join if you can! Yours truly might even make an appearance!</li>
        <li>We are organizing a protest against the proposed budget cuts for special education [link=527f36a7-c0b6-4b9a-be4e-5dbc89370622]! If you are available please join us in this protest, we will announce an online component for people who cannot attend but want to make some noise in the coming weeks</li>
    </ul>
    <p> As always, be well and let me know if there’s anything I or EEA can help you with. Have a great day everyone! :)</p>
    <p> Esther</p>
