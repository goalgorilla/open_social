    <p>I’m not sure if handing out flyers is still a thing (you never know haha) but I want to hand some out at education event I’m going to soon. Does EEA have any materials I can use? Maybe it would be good to send some to all members if possible!</p>

    <p>Hi everyone in the EEA online community! </p>
    <p>It’s time for our monthly EEA update! </p>
    <p>First and foremost I’d like to thank all the volunteers that helped cold calling universities to help kickstart our campaign to get a nation wide policy for educational assistance in higher education! Special shout-out to [~Cb92f0c9-1d34-4c05-a50b-2ea985342953] who got TEN universities to support our campaign! </p>
    <p>We are currently working hard on the follow up of the campaign. Other things that are happening surrounding the EEA community right now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We are working on a new volunteer handbook. London based volunteers can review the latest draft in the London volunteer group</li>
        <li>Birmingham based teachers: [~42fc0a3c-5e90-44a3-bfab-8b0ea7b6dead] is organizing the first teacher meetup in your area [link=4bc246e0-7061-4a2e-977a-35da40575a1c], be sure to join if you can! Yours truly might even make an appearance!</li>
        <li>We are organizing an event to raise awareness for Earth Day! If you are available please join us. We will announce an online component for people who cannot attend but want to make some noise in the coming weeks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> As always, be well and let me know if there’s anything I or EEA can help you with. Have a great day everyone! :)</p>
    <p> Esther</p>
