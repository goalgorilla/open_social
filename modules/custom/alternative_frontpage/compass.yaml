  Allows sitemanagers to configure different front pages that should be shown for different roles.


  Tagged for rework because we may not want to tie this to roles in the future. We also don't currently have proper control over the order of
  selection, nor is the front page actually rendered as front page (at `/`) but instead this is done through redirects to less friendly paths.
