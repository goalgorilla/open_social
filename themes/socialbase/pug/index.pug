                  strong Open Social is a Drupal 8 distribution for building social communities and intranets.

                p For those of you who don't know what a Style Guide is - it's quite simple really. A Style Guide is a set of standards to ensure a consistent design and identity. Additionally, from a development point of view it serves to improve the speed and ease of code deployment. A style guide consolidates the front-end code while comprehensively documenting the visual language, such as color palettes and fonts.

                p The goals for creating this style guide are:
                ol
                  li Streamline the workflow for designers and developers
                  li Maintain a consistency of the theme styles and components
                  li Create a focal point for our Design and User Experience work, both for ourselves and for the community

                p This theme is built upon <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap"> Drupal Bootstrap</a>, which means Bootstrap is used as the base theme. Furthermore it is enhanced with a default brand styling and extra components. For the extra components <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html"> Material Design principles</a> are used.

                p
                  <strong> Status: </strong> We are currently in beta phase.
