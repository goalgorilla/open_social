            Thanks for contributing towards Open Social! A maintainer from the @goalgorilla/maintainers group might not review all changes from all teams / contributors. Please don't be discouraged if it takes a while.
            In the meantime, we have some automated checks running and it might be that you will see me comment with some tips or requests to speed up the review process. :blush:

              - begin with Internal: if it's related to an internal ticket

            The team, status, prio and type labels are very helpful in giving more information about a PR at first glance.
            They are used for providing more information about the PR, for example, the status label shows if the PR is ready for review or not.
            Don't worry if you're unsure what labels to pick, our maintainers will be able to assist you with that.
