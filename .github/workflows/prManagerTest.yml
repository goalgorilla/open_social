# We use the default concurrency grouping of allowing a single workflow per branch/PR/tag to run at the same time.
# In case of PRs we only care about the results for the last workflow run, so we cancel workflows already in progress
# when new code is pushed, in all other cases (branches/tags) we want to have a history for commits so it's easier to
# find breakages when they occur (head_ref is non-empty only when the workflow is triggered from a PR).
