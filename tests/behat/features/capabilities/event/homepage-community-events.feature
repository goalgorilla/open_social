  Goal/desire: I want to see upcoming events of the community on the homepages

  Scenario: Successfully show my upcoming events as a LU
#    TODO: Test visibility settings (Public, Community)

    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should not see "Behat Event 1"
    And I should not see "Behat Event 2"
