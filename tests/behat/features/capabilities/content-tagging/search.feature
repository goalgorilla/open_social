Feature: Filtering search with content tags
  The content tags provide a way to filter search results.

  Background:
    Given I enable the module social_tagging
    And social_tagging terms:
      | name      | parent   |
      | Clothing  |          |
      | Pants     | Clothing |
      | Shoes     | Clothing |

  Scenario: Find a group by a parent category of a tag
    Given I enable the module social_group_flexible_group
    And groups with non-anonymous owner:
      | label                  | type           | field_flexible_group_visibility | field_social_tagging |
      | Group with target tag  | flexible_group | public                          | Pants                |
      | Group with another tag | flexible_group | public                          | Shoes                |
      | Group without a tag    | flexible_group | public                          |                      |
