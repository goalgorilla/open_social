  Scenario: Successfully create Book page
    Given I am logged in as an "administrator"

      | Title | This is my first novel |
    And I fill in the "edit-body-0-value" WYSIWYG editor with "This is a book all about me. An autobiography so to speak!"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Book page This is my first novel has been created."
