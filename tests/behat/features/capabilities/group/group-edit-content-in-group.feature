    # Create a new topic
    When I am logged in as "harry"
    And I am on "/all-groups"
    And I click "Motorboats"
    And I click "Join"
    And I press "Join group"
    And I am on "node/add/topic"
    And I select group "Kayaking"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    Then I should see "Changing the group may have impact on the visibility settings."
    And I fill in "Title" with "I love this sport"
    And I fill in the "edit-body-0-value" WYSIWYG editor with "Do you to?"
    And I click radio button "Discussion"
    And I press "Save"
    And I should see "Kayaking" in the "Main content"
    And I wait for "2" seconds

    # Edit topic
    When I click "Edit content"
    Then I should see "Moving content after creation function has been disabled. In order to move this content, please contact a site manager."
