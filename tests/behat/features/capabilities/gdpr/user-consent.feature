@api @gdpr @user-consent @DS-5586 @stability @stability-4
Feature: Give user consent
  Benefit: So I can decide what to do with users personal data
  Role: As a SM
  Goal/desire: I want to know which users did (not) gave consent to the data policy

  Scenario: Successfully view user consent
    Given I enable the module "social_gdpr"
    And users:
      | name             | mail                         | status | roles       |
      | behatsitemanager | behatsitemanager@example.com | 1      | sitemanager |
      | behatuser1       | behatuser1@example.com       | 1      | verified    |
      | behatuser2       | behatuser2@example.com       | 1      | verified    |
      | behatuser3       | behatuser3@example.com       | 1      | verified    |
    And data_policies:
      | name               | field_description       |
      | Terms & Conditions | No rights in this test  |
    And I set the GDPR Consent Text to "I agree with the [id:1]"
    And I am logged in as "behatuser1"

    Then I should be on the homepage
    And I should see the success message "We published a new version of the data policy. You can review the data policy here."

    When I click "here"
    Then I should be on "data-policy-agreement"

    And I am on "admin/reports/data-policy-agreements"
    Then I should not see the text "User consents not found."
    And I should see "Undecided" in the "td.views-field-state" element

    When I am logged in as "behatuser1"
    # We changed the behavior. So now if a user visited the agreement page and leave it in the case when data policy
    # is not required, then we still display a status link that we published a new version of data policy until the
    # user saves the form.
    Then I should see the success message "We published a new version of the data policy. You can review the data policy here."
    When I am on "data-policy-agreement"
