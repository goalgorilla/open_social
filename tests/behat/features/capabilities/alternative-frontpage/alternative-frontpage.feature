  Goal/desire: I want to set a different frontpage for Anonymous and Logged-in users

  Scenario: Successfully set alternative frontpage

    Given I enable the module "alternative_frontpage"
    Given page content:
      | title          | status | field_content_visibility | alias         |
      | Frontpage AN   | 1      | public                   | /frontpage-an |
      | Frontpage LU   | 1      | community                | /frontpage-lu |
    # Configure the settings
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administer alternative frontpage settings" permission
    When I am on "admin/config/alternative_frontpage"
    # Error validation
    And I fill in the following:
      | Frontpage for anonymous users     |              |
      | Frontpage for authenticated users | /user/logout |
    And I press "Save configuration"
    Then I should see "The path for the anonymous frontpage cannot be empty."
    And I should see "The path for the authenticated frontpage is not allowed."

      | Frontpage for anonymous users     | stream       |
      | Frontpage for authenticated users | invalid page |
    And I press "Save configuration"
    Then I should see "The path for the anonymous frontpage should start with a forward slash."
    And I should see "The path for the authenticated frontpage is not valid."
    # Fill in the correct settings.
