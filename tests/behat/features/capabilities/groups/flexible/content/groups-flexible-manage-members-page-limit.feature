  Scenario: User can control the number of items displayed on the Manage members overview page
    Given I am logged in as a user with the sitemanager role

    When I am viewing the group "Flexible group"

    And I click "Manage members"
    And I should see "27 members"
    And I select "50" from "items_per_page"

    # Should be displayed all items without page.
    Then I should not see the link "Next"
    And I should not see the link "Last"

    # Check that selected number of items now is permanent for the current user.
    And I click "About"
    And I click "Manage members"
    And should see "50" selected in the "items_per_page" select field
    And I should not see the link "Next"
    And I should not see the link "Last"
