    And I am on "node/add/topic"
    When I fill in "Title" with "This is a topic for community"
    And I fill in the "edit-body-0-value" WYSIWYG editor with "This is a topic for community"
    And I click radio button "Community - visible only to logged in members"
    And I click radio button "Discussion"
    And I press "Save"
